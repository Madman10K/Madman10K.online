# Hey there
I am Stanislav, also known as Madman10K, I am 17 years old and mainly work on applications using C and C++

## About
I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria üáßüá¨.

I started programming when I was 12, with the idea of making games. I started with Unity, but found it 
very hard to use. After a month of using it, I switched to using 
[Unreal Engine 4.18](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-4-18-released), with which, I spent 2 years building games.

After making a couple of unfinished games(but gaining a lot of experience on the way), I decided to take my Unreal Engine knowledge and make a 
game engine called the [UntitledVulkanGameEngine](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledVulkanGameEngine). I was 14 in 2020, when I started working on it.

In July 2022, I started the [UntitledDesktopEnvironment](https://madladsquad.com/desktop) under [MadLadSquad](https://madladsquad.com). I'm currently the only developer, so I work on all aspects of it. The goal is to make an independent Linux desktop environment like [Gnome](https://gnome.org/) and [KDE](https://kde.org/). It includes a custom implementation of almost all core DE features, including a custom-built desktop application framework, the [UntitledImGuiFramework](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledImGuiFramework).

## Work experience
I have done paid commissions since 2020 but they have mostly been rare(i.e. once every 3-4 months) and private, so no details can be discussed here. 
What I can say is that I worked on various C++ projects with my job being:
1. Fixing bugs
1. Refactoring, modernizing and cleaning up a codebase
1. Porting a codebase from Windows to Unix or vice versa
1. Other various programing work including writing small features for apps, implementing data structures and abstractions, and doing other general 
software development work

Outside of this, since I was in my period of game development January 2018 to December 2021, I also had the experience of managing a game project with 
other people. Specifically I worked on it with a team of 2 other people, an artist and a musician

## Programming knowledge
I have written a lot of code in the following programming languages:
1. C and C++ - I have been using them for over 4 years
1. Python - I have been using it for some projects for about a year
1. Bash and shell - I have been using bash and shell scripts for over 2 years
1. Golang - I maintain a discord bot written in golang that I update yearly since 2021
1. HTML + CSS + Javascript + Markdown - I have been using the traditional frontend web stack from time to time during the last 5 years, but mostly on 
and off. The main websites I have worked on are [my website](https://madman10k.online/), [the madladsquad site](https://madladsquad.com/) and 
[youyin](https://youyin.madladsquad.com/)

Other than that, because I mainly work on libraries, frameworks, game engines and development tools, I have a lot of knowledge in developing a library or
framework with a nice interface. And as expected I know a good number of things about modern and historical hardware and systems, together with basic
assembly for debugging and optimizing programs.

## Languages
Here are the languages I am currently learning:
1. Bulgarian üáßüá¨ - native
1. English üá¨üáß - between C1 and C2
1. German üá©üá™ - between A2 and B1
1. Mandarin Chinese(simplified characters) üá®üá≥ - HSK3(new)

Additionally sometimes when I'm not learning Mandarin or German I learn the following languages:
1. Russian üá∑üá∫
1. Macedonian üá≤üá∞
1. Serbo-Croatian üá∑üá∏üá≠üá∑
1. Japanese üáØüáµ
