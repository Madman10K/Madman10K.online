# Hey there
I am Stanislav, also known as Madman10K, I am 17 years old and mainly work on applications using C and C++

## About
I was born in the country of Bulgaria 🇧🇬 and the capital(also the biggest city), Sofia.

I started programming when I was 12 with the idea to start making games and other entertainment products using software. I started with Unity but found it 
very hard to use so after a month of using it, I switched to using 
[Unreal Engine 4.18](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-4-18-released) with which I spent 2 years building games.

After making a couple of games that were never finished(but gaining a lot of experience on the way) I decided to take my Unreal Engine knowledge and make a 
game engine called the [UntitledVulkanGameEngine](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledVulkanGameEngine) on which I started working since I was 14 and am 
still working on! 

The goal of the engine was to replicate some of the features of Unreal Engine which I liked and to make a prototype game engine that can be potentially 
used by a real game development studio.

Now with 2 years and counting of developing the engine, I am working on both software around the engine and other software outside of it, a complete list 
of projects is provided below

## Projects

with multiple more projects planned for later. The large majority of them are created under [MadLad Squad](https://github.com/MadLadSquad) which is a 
github organization I and other users use to collaborate on all the software listed above.

## Current projects
I am currently working on the following projects:
- UntitledDesktopEnvironment
- [i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) support in [Funtoo linux](https://www.funtoo.org/Funtoo:CJK)
- Supporting the projects with no finished date in the timeline when support it is needed

## Work experience
I have done paid commissions since 2020 but they have mostly been rare(i.e. once every 3-4 months) and private, so no details can be discussed here. 
What I can say is that I worked on various C++ projects with my job being:
1. Fixing bugs
1. Refactoring, modernizing and cleaning up a codebase
1. Porting a codebase from Windows to Unix or vice versa
1. Other various programing work including writing small features for apps, implementing data structures and abstractions, and doing other general 
software development work

Outside of this, since I was in my period of game development January 2018 to December 2021, I also had the experience of managing a game project with 
other people. Specifically I worked on it with a team of 2 other people, an artist and a musician

## Programming knowledge
I have written a lot of code in the following programming languages:
1. C and C++ - I have been using them for over 4 years
1. Python - I have been using it for some projects for about a year
1. Bash and shell - I have been using bash and shell scripts for over 2 years
1. Golang - I maintain a discord bot written in golang that I update yearly since 2021
1. HTML + CSS + Javascript + Markdown - I have been using the traditional frontend web stack from time to time during the last 5 years, but mostly on 
and off. The main websites I have worked on are [my website](https://madman10k.online/), [the madladsquad site](https://madladsquad.com/) and 
[youyin](https://youyin.madladsquad.com/)

Other than that, because I mainly work on libraries, frameworks, game engines and development tools, I have a lot of knowledge in developing a library or
framework with a nice interface. And as expected I know a good number of things about modern and historical hardware and systems, together with basic
assembly for debugging and optimizing programs.

## Languages
Here are the languages I am currently learning:
1. Bulgarian 🇧🇬 - native
1. English 🇬🇧 - between C1 and C2
1. German 🇩🇪 - A2
1. Mandarin Chinese(simplified characters) 🇨🇳 - HSK2

Additionally sometimes when I'm not learning Mandarin or German I learn the following languages:
1. Russian 🇷🇺
1. Macedonian 🇲🇰
1. Serbo-Croatian 🇷🇸🇭🇷
1. Japanese 🇯🇵
