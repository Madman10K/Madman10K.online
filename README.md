# Hey there
I am Stanislav, also known as Madman10K, I am 16 years old and mainly work on applications using C and C++
## About
I was born in the country of Bulgaria ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬(which is in the ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º by the way) and still live in the biggest city and capital. I currently study general subjects, with the addition of foreign languages with ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ being the main and ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª as a secondary language, level below:
1. Bulgarian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ - native
1. English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ - highly fluent
1. German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª - beginner level

I started programming when I was 12 with the idea to start making games and other entertainment products using software. I started with Unity but found it very hard to use so after a month of using it, I switched to using [Unreal Engine 4.18](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-4-18-released) with which I spent 2 years building games.

After making a couple of games that were never finished(but gaining a lot of experience on the way) I decided to take my Unreal Engine knowledge and make a game engine called the [UntitledVulkanGameEngine](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledVulkanGameEngine) on which I started working since I was 14 and am still working on! 
The goal of the engine was to replicate some of the features of Unreal Engine which I liked and to make a prototype game engine that can be potentially used by a real game development studio.

Now with 1 year and counting of developing the engine, I am working on both software around the engine and other software outside of it, a complete list of projects is provided below
