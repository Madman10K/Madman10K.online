# From UE4 to my own game engine
So when I was 6th grade at 12 years old I decided to make a game. Searching up "How to make a game" on youtube gave me a lot of results, most would recommend Unity for beginners. Here begins my short paragraph about why I don't like Unity
## Why I don't like Unity
I do not understand why most youtubers and people on blogs recommend Unity. When I first started out I looked at it and was confused by all the strange icons and buttons. Since English is my second language I didn't know that things like RigidBody means Physics. Then I had to learn C#, now at that point I had never touched a programming language. So I was super confused because stuff I needed was hidden behind unnecessary panels, such as extensions, asset packs and more and also I had to learn programming for the first time. So after that I switched to Unreal Engine 4. 
## My Unreal Engine 4 experience
So after being super dissapointed with how bad I am at Unity I decided to use Unreal. When I launched in the Editor it looked very organized, I found things where I wanted to find them and so on. I also didn't have to learn a programming language which was C++ in Unreal. So I made some scenes, made FPS movement and gameplay and played around. When I was 13 I started making full fledged games but I really failed due to demotivation and having problems with my PC at the time which had an Intel Core i3 6100 and a NVidia GT 1030. When I got my build upgraded I countinued making games in Unreal until I decided to make my own renderer.
## My experience with graphics programming before 2020
So I was 13 when I decided to make my own game renderer. I tried following The Cherno's OpenGL series but there were some problems with me not understanding C++ very much and also having to deal with errors where I missclicked something in Visual Studio's GUI. So after I got a moving triangle on the screen I basically gave up
## 2020 and graphics programming
### Pandemic 2020
So now 14, in march I went into lockdown and school from home. Now If you know something about students I obviously didn't listen to my teachers in classes deciding to work on my Unreal games and talking to my friends on discord while having MS Teams muted. 
### Getting the idea for the UntitledVulkanGameEngine
So one day I was playing Counter Strike with one of my friends and he said that he bet $500 that I cannot make a Vulkan game engine. I remembered about 2019 when I was doing OpenGL so I decided to prove him wrong. I bought a course on Udemy by Ben Cook linked [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-the-vulkan-api-with-cpp/). I was actually doing pretty well and I understood most of the stuff but after failing in doing abstracion in some areas I gave up in July, because my API was too complex but I made a treallo board for a future engine when I return. Then I continued making games in Unreal until September. 
### Second iteration of the engine
In mid September I started working on a new game engine with a new good API, however I messed up the API again and after 3 redesigns in November 2020 I finally understood abstraction techniques and learned from my past mistakes. In the end of December 2020 I stopped working on my final game in Unreal called Project Spoon where I worked with a guy called Spoon. Which marks an end of 2 years of me using Unreal Engine 4. After that moment I worked exclusively on the game engine and software related to it.
## Wrapup
One very important thing to say is that I learned more C++ from the game engine in a month than from UE4 in 2 years and I think that without the engine I probably wouldn't be at the level of C++ I am at now. I seriously recommend everyone makes a game engine with a goal of a clear API with lots of abstraction because for me at least it made my C++ better. Also getting software ideas on dares is a very good way to get motivation.
