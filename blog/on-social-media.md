# On social media
This is going to be your generic opinionated rambling on why social media is bad and you shouldn't use it. Also I'm going to also cover video games here. 

Warning: The following text is highly opinionated and the only things that support the thesis are my own personal experiences :)

## It's a waste of time
Scrolling trough social media is a genuine waste of time, most people spend at least 1-2 hours a day mindlessly scrolling. The truth is that social media algorithms are made so that they capture your attention and distract you.

For video games it's even worse, when you play a video game and you finish a task you feel like you actually achieved something but in reality you didn't. Videogames phsychologically trick your brain into thinking that a task was finished, your brain then rewards you with happiness hormones and so you play even more and more games

The worst thing about both of these is that many people loose multiple hours every day chasing worthless achievements(getting likes on your post or getting a better rank in a competitive game) and they trick their brain that they actually achieved something when in reality they never did anything.
## It's worse for your mental health
While I myself never had problems with mental health as a result of social media, many of my friends have. One close friend(whoose name I will not mention) got a heavy depression from instagram, he lives in Denmark and because of the weather and his work situation(he worked a boring office job) he got depressed from looking at people's pictures, from tropical destinations, that seemingly lived a very good life. In reality what is often said is that almost nobody lives a lifestyle like this, unfortunately even knowing this it might not help. But when he stopped using instagram he immediately got better and started enjoying life
## You will never be famous
This needs to be heard, you will never be famous, statistically the chance of becoming famous on the internet is less than 0.01% and even if you become famous for some time your fame probably won't last more than a couple of days to a week
## Don't be yourself
Here is another thing that needs to be heard. Influencers, celebrities and so on always call on people to be themselves. Unfortunately whomever confused the entire world with the idea that humans are generally smart really did a great job. To ask the question "Should you be yourself?", the answer for the average person should be a "No", the large amount of population on earth is uneducated, either because they never got any education or beause they never decided to get educated above what school has to offer.

A normal distribution of the population is be 45% uneducated, 45% slightly educated and 10% of highly educated individuals. The mass of the 90% should follow what the top 10% are doing and not listeding to themselves. Every person is born ignorant, and the cure for ignorance is education and educated rolemodels. Unfortunately celebrities are not one of them
## Long distance internet relationships are not real
Another problem of social media is that people create long distance internet only relationships and lie to themselves that they have an actual friend. Unfortunately real relationships form in real life. It is important to be noted that you can use the internet to find people to be friends with in real life and use the internet to easily introduce yourself to new people, in which case you meet people in real life and still form a solid friendship
## Influencers, companies and strangers are not your friend
This is a continuation of the previous point and what I mean by this is that many people form parasocial relationships with influencers, brands, companies and even strangers on the internet. This is most prevalent on platforms like youtube or twitch where people create a one way connection with starangers without even talking to them or knowing who they are as a person behing the scenes
