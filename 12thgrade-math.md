In this document, I will explain the whole math material for 11th and 12th grade in Bulgaria, because if I don't do it I'm not finishing school :skull:

## 11th grade

## Equations
### Powers
Something like this $`2^{x+3} = 8`$ is solved by extracting the power and solving the equation $`2^{x+3} = 2^3`$, which results in the following: $`x + 3 = 3`$. Therefore $`x = 3`$

An equation like this $`a^{f(x)} = a^{g(x)}`$ is solved by solving $`f(x) = g(x)`$. For example: $`3^{-3x} = {1 \over 9^(x + 1)} => 3^{-3x} = {1 \over 3^{2x + 2}} => 3^{-3x} = 3^{-2x-2} => -3x = -2x-2 => x = 2`$

Something like this: $`9 \times 5^{3x-1} - 25 \times 3^{3x-1} = 0`$ is solved by extracting the powers $`3^2 \times 5^{3x-1} = 5^2 \times 3^{3x-1} => 3^2 \times {5^{3x-1} \over 3^{3x-1}} = 5^2 => {5 \over 3}^{3x-1} = {5 \over 3}^2 => 3x-1 = 2 => 3x = 3 => x = 1`$

### Logarithms
Some thing like this: $`log_3(2x+-1) = 2`$ is solved by tracking back the value of the logarithm: $`2x - 1 = 3^2 => 2x = 10 => x = 5`$

Solving something like this: $`log_{1 \over 3}^3(x) + 2log_{1\over3}^2(x) - 3log_{1\over3}(x) = 0`$ is solved by substituting with a variable $`z = log_{1\over3}(x) => z^3 + 2z^2 - 3z = 0 => z(z + 3)(z - 1) = 0 => z_1 = 0, z_2 = 1, z_3 = -3`$. You can solve it further yourself.

Solving something like this: $`log_2(x) + 3log_x(2) = 4`$ is solved by using the inverse property of logarithms where $`log_x(2) = {1 \over log_2(x)}`$. Therefore: $`log_2(x) + {3 \over log_2(x)} = 4 => z = log_2(x) => z + {3 \over z} = 4 => z^2 - 4z + 3 = 0 => z_1 = 1 \cup z_2 = 3`$
